Almost there, hold a bit tighter!
# h1-room, h1-hermione, h1-hand-transparent

Well, hi.
> ...

Spirit?
> Gulp. Yes, yes. Um... hi.
Are you ok? Not get used to this reality yet?
> No, the opposite. You look very familiar, you know.
# h1-room, h1-hermione, h1-hermione-surprised, h1-hand-transparent
Really?
> Yep. Didn't expect to see you here though.
Um... Do you know me?
> I guess. Hermione?
# h1-room, h1-hermione, h1-hermione-super-surprised, h1-hand-transparent
WHAT!? How?
# h1-room, h1-hermione, h1-hermione-laughing, h1-hand-transparent
Oh... You are a magical spirit after all.
# h1-room, h1-hermione, h1-hand-transparent
Anyway, I summoned you for a reason.
It's a bit embarrassing for me, but I really need this.
# h1-room, h1-hermione, h1-hermione-speaking, h1-hand-transparent
You see, when I started to work as a professor, I thought with my knowledge it would be easy.
But big part of work is about managing students behaivior, which is a nightmare.
# h1-room, h1-hermione, h1-hand-transparent
> Wait, you working as a professor now?
# h1-room, h1-hermione, h1-hermione-speaking, h1-hand-transparent
Yep, I was thinking to work for the Ministry of Magic, but decided to go back to the Hogwarts, because there is so many good memories.
So many adventures, but mostly tutor sessions with professor Dumbledore...
# h1-room, h1-hermione, h1-hand-transparent
> Hmmm... I see. By the way, is this a ragular uniform for a professor now?
Sure, by the order of professor Dumbledor when I were a student.
> Right, right. So, how long do we need to hold hands?
# h1-room, h1-hermione, h1-hermione-surprised, h1-hand-transparent
Oh, sorry! Forgot about that. I think you are stable and can let go.
# h1-room, h1-hermione-hands-back
So as I was saying... Professor's life is not easy at all.
And, and...
> What is it?
# h1-room, h1-hermione-hands-back, h1-hermione-closed-eyes-speaking
I'm at a very bad position. I'm barely holding.
# h1-room, h1-hermione-hands-back
I know at this rate I'm gonna be fired soon.
> You are smart as hell, you gonna be fine.
# h1-room, h1-hermione-hands-back, h1-hermione-closed-eyes-speaking
Thanks, but no. Managing teenagers making me angry. Like, really angry and exhausted.
# h1-room, h1-hermione-hands-back
I dont want to be fired, but it's not only about me, but about all professors that worked before me and their legacy. I can not let them down.
> Hmmm... Still dont get why you need me.
# h1-room, h1-hermione-hands-back, h1-hermione-speaking
So I was searching for what could help me and I found a recipe for a potion.
This potion is like Felix Felicis but without by-effects! And it's even more powerful and last longer!
# h1-room, h1-hermione-hands-back
I'm pretty sure it's my only chance not to loose a job.
> Aaand... Why you need me?
# h1-room, h1-hermione-hands-back, h1-hermione-speaking
Right, right. So, one of the ingridients is a special essence of a spirit.
The essence is... Well. Khm-khm...
# h1-room, h1-hermione-hands-back, h1-hermione-speaking
It's an analogical for a human semen!
# h1-room, h1-hermione-hands-back, h1-hermione-surprised
Eh.. I cant believe I said that.
> Oh my... Ok, ok. I see. Well, I think I could help, yeah.
Really?!
> Sure.
# h1-room, h1-hermione-hands-back, h1-hermione-laughing
Oh, I was so nervous that you gonna refuse. Thank you so much! 
I've read a lot about how to serve... I mean, how to extract the essence.
# h1-room, h1-hermione-hands-back
So don't you worry. Shall we start right away?
>> Oh, absolutely! (h1-table)
> I would like to know more about how you gonna do it. You know, just in case.
# h1-room, h1-hermione-hands-back, h1-hermione-speaking
Sure, I'm gonna sit on the edge of the table and...
# h1-room, h1-hermione-hands-back
I'm gonna use my hands. If it's ok with you.
> Just hands?
# h1-room, h1-hermione-hands-back, h1-hermione-surprised
What are you hinting at? I'm a good girl!
Besides, you are innormasly huge, so... Even if I would...
# h1-room, h1-hermione-hands-back, h1-hermione-closed-eyes-speaking
Anything besides hands is just physically impossible.
# h1-room, h1-hermione-hands-back, h1-hermione-surprised
It's not that I would want that of course.
# h1-room, h1-hermione-hands-back
So, ready to start?
>> Oh, absolutely! (h1-table)
