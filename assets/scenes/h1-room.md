Almost there, hold a bit tighter!
# h1-room

Well, hi.
> ...
Spirit?
> Yes, yes. Um... hi.
Are you ok? Not get used to this reality yet?
> No, the opposite. You look very familiar, you know.
# h1-room, h1-hermione-surprised
Really?
> Yep. Didn't expect to see you here though.
Um... Do you know me?
> I guess. Hermione?
# h1-room,  h1-hermione-super-surprised
WHAT!? How?
# h1-room, h1-hermione-laughing
Oh... You are a magical spirit after all.
# h1-room
Anyway, I summoned you for a reason.
It's a bit embarrassing for me, but I really need this.
# h1-room, h1-hermione-speaking
You see, when I started to work as a professor, I thought with my knowledge it would be easy.
But big part of work is about managing students behaivior, which is a nightmare.
# h1-room
> Wait, you working as a professor now?
# h1-room, h1-hermione-speaking
Yep, I was thinking to work for the Ministry of Magic, but decided to go back to the Hogwarts, because there is so many good memories.
# h1-room
So many adventures, but mostly tutor sessions with professor Dumbledore...
> Hmmm... I see. By the way, is this a ragular uniform for a professor now?
Sure. It was set by the order of professor Dumbledor at the time when I was a student.
> Right, right. So, how long do we need to hold hands?
# h1-room, h1-hermione-surprised
Oh, sorry! Forgot about that. I think you are stable and can let go.
# h1-room-hands-back
So as I was saying... Professor's life is not easy at all.
And, and...
> What is it?
# h1-room-hands-back, h1-hermione-closed-eyes-speaking
I'm at a very bad position. I'm barely holding.
# h1-room-hands-back
At this rate I'm gonna be fired soon.
> You are smart as hell, you gonna be fine.
# h1-room-hands-back, h1-hermione-closed-eyes-speaking
Thanks, but no. Managing teenagers making me angry. Like, re-e-ally angry.
I cant make my students concentrate and I'm getting so exhausted trying.
> I can see why they can't concentrate.
# h1-room-hands-back
Huh?
Anyway, I dont want to be fired, but it's not only about me!
It is about all the professors that worked before me and their legacy. I can not let them down!
> Hmmm... I just don't get why you need me.
# h1-room-hands-back, h1-hermione-speaking
So I was searching for what could help me and I found a recipe for a magnificent potion.
This potion is like Felix Felicis but without by-effects! And it's even more powerful and last longer!
# h1-room-hands-back
I'm pretty sure it's my only chance not to loose a job.
> Aaand... Why you need me?
# h1-room-hands-back, h1-hermione-speaking
Right, right. So, one of the ingridients is a special essence of a spirit.
The essence is... Well. Khm-khm...
# h1-room-hands-back, h1-hermione-speaking
It's an analogical for a human semen!
# h1-room-hands-back, h1-hermione-surprised
Eh.. I cant believe I said that.
> Oh my... Ok, ok. I see. Well, I think I could help, yeah.
Really?!
> Sure.
# h1-room-hands-back, h1-hermione-laughing
Oh, I was so nervous that you gonna refuse. Thank you so much! 
I've read a all the books about how to serve... I mean, how to extract the essence.
# h1-room-hands-back
So don't you worry. Shall we start right away?
>> Oh, absolutely! (h1-table)
> I would like to know more about how you gonna do it. You know, just in case.
# h1-room-hands-back, h1-hermione-speaking
Sure, I'm gonna sit on... Khm-khm...
Sit on the edge of the table and...
# h1-room-hands-back
I'm gonna use my hands. If it's ok with you.
> Just hands?
# h1-room-hands-back, h1-hermione-surprised
What are you hinting at? I just need an essence.
I'm not that kind of a girl who would jump on each ... um.. sausage.
> Sausage?
You know what I mean! Besides, you are innormasly huge, so... Even if I want to...
# h1-room-hands-back, h1-hermione-closed-eyes-speaking
It would be just physically impossible.
# h1-room-hands-back, h1-hermione-surprised
It's not that I would want that of course.
# h1-room-hands-back
So, ready to start?
>> Oh, absolutely! (h1-table)
