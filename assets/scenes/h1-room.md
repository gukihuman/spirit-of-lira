We're nearly there, just hold on a little tighter!
# h1-room

Well, Hi! Welcome to the realm!
> ...
You're a spirit, correct?
> Yes, yes. Um... Hi.
Are you okay? Have you not accustomed to this reality yet?
> Actually, it's the contrary. You seem awfully familiar.
# h1-room, h1-hermione-surprised
Really?
> Yep. I wasn't expected to meet you here though.
So, you know who I am!?
> Well, I think so.
# h1-room,  h1-hermione-super-surprised
WHAT!? How?
# h1-room, h1-hermione-laughing
Oh... I suppose you are a magical spirit, after all.
# h1-room
Anyway, I didn't summon you for no reason.
This might be slightly embarrassing, but I desperately require your help.
# h1-room, h1-hermione-speaking
When I commenced my role as a professor, I assumed with my knowledge it would be simple.
But a considerable part of the job involves regulating student behavior, and it feels impossible.
# h1-room
> Wait, you're a professor now?
# h1-room, h1-hermione-speaking
Yes, indeed. Initially, I planned to work for the Council of Sorcery, but I decided to return to the school due to the various cherished memories.
# h1-room
Countless adventures...
But primarily, it was the mentorship sessions with the head of the school that drew me back.
> I see. And, by the way, is this standard professorial uniform?
Absolutely. It's a directive that was put into place during my student days by the head of the school.
> Right, right. So, how long do we need to hold hands?
# h1-room, h1-hermione-surprised
Oh, apologies! I completely forgot about that. I think you can let go now, you seem stable.
# h1-room-hands-back
As I was saying earlier... Being a professor isn't as effortless as it seems.
And, and...
> What's wrong?
# h1-room-hands-back, h1-hermione-closed-eyes-speaking
I'm in quite a predicament. I'm barely hanging on.
# h1-room-hands-back
At this rate, I'll be dismissed soon.
> You're incredibly intelligent. I'm sure you gonna be fine.
# h1-room-hands-back, h1-hermione-closed-eyes-speaking
Thank you, but that's not the case. The struggles of managing teenagers infuriates me. It's really draining trying to make my students focus.
> I can see why they can't concentrate.
# h1-room-hands-back
Huh?
Anyway, I don't want to lose my job, but it's not just about me!
It's about all the preceding professors and their ongoing legacy. I cannot disappoint them!
> Right, I just don't get it why you need me.
# h1-room-hands-back, h1-hermione-speaking
I've been researching potential solutions and happened upon a recipe for a remarkable potion.
This potion is similar to the famous Elixir of Fortune, but without any side-effects! And it offers even more potent effects that last longer!
# h1-room-hands-back
I believe it's my only hope of retaining my job.
> Yes, but why do you need me specifically?
# h1-room-hands-back, h1-hermione-speaking
Right, well, one of the ingredients is a unique spirit essence.
The essence is... well, um...
# h1-room-hands-back, h1-hermione-speaking
It's the equivalent of human semen!
# h1-room-hands-back, h1-hermione-surprised
Ah.. I can't believe I just said that.
> Oh! Well, uh, I think I can help with that.
Really?!
> Of course.
# h1-room-hands-back, h1-hermione-laughing
I'm so relieved! I was apprehensive that you would decline.
I've gathered all the required information on how to extract... the essence.
# h1-room-hands-back
So don't you worry. Shall we start right away?
>> Oh, absolutely! (h1-table)
> Could you provide more details on the extraction process? You know, just in case.
# h1-room-hands-back, h1-hermione-speaking
Of course, I... I will seat myself on...
... on the edge of the table and...
# h1-room-hands-back
I will utilizing my hands, if that suits you.
> Just your hands?
# h1-room-hands-back, h1-hermione-surprised
What are you implying? I need the essence, not anything more unnecessary.
I'm not the type of woman to exploit every... opportunity.
> Opportunity?
You understand my point! Additionally, you're unreasonably large, so... Even if I wanted to...
# h1-room-hands-back, h1-hermione-closed-eyes-speaking
It would be physically impossible.
# h1-room-hands-back, h1-hermione-surprised
I didn't mean to suggest otherwise, of course.
# h1-room-hands-back
So, are you ready to start?
>> Oh, absolutely! (h1-table)
