We're nearly there, just hold on a little tighter!
# h1-room

# h1-room, h1-hermione-laughing
Well, Hi! Welcome to the realm!
> ...
# h1-room
You're a spirit, correct?
> Yes, yes. Um... Hi.
Are you okay? Have you not accustomed to this reality yet?
> Actually, it's the contrary. You seem awfully familiar.
# h1-room, h1-hermione-surprised
Really?
> Yep. I wasn't expected to meet you here though.
So, you know who I am?!
> Well, I think so.
# h1-room, h1-hermione-super-surprised
WHAT!? How?
# h1-room, h1-hermione-laughing
Oh... I suppose you are a magical spirit, after all.
# h1-room
Anyway, I didn't summon you for no reason.
This might be slightly embarrassing, but I desperately require your help.
# h1-room, h1-hermione-speaking
Recently, I started my job as a professor. I assumed with my knowledge it would be simple.
# h1-room
But a considerable part of the job involves regulating student behavior, and it feels impossible.
> Wait, you're a professor now?
# h1-room, h1-hermione-speaking
Yes, indeed. Initially, I planned to work for the Council of Sorcery, but I decided to return to the school due to the various cherished memories.
Countless adventures...
# h1-room
But primarily, it was the mentorship sessions with the head of the school that drew me back.
> I understand. Perhaps I could help refresh those memories.
In what way?
> Just a hunch I have. By the way, is this standard professorial uniform?
# h1-room, h1-hermione-speaking
Absolutely. It's a directive that was put into place during my student days by the head of the school.
# h1-room
> Right, right. So, how long do we need to hold hands?
# h1-room, h1-hermione-surprised
Oh, apologies! I completely forgot about that. I think you can let go now, you seem stable.
# h1-room-hands-back, h1-hermione-speaking

So as I was saying... Being a professor isn't as effortless as it seems.
And, and...
> What's wrong?
# h1-room-hands-back, h1-hermione-sad
I'm in quite a predicament. I'm barely hanging on.
At this rate, I'll be dismissed soon.
> You're incredibly intelligent. I'm sure you gonna be fine.
Thank you, but that's not the case. The struggles of managing teenagers infuriates me.
> Well.. schools are always a tough place. Maybe you just need more time to adjust to this role?
# h1-room-hands-back, h1-hermione-closed-eyes-speaking
I hope you're correct. But you know, time isn't my friend right now.
It's really draining trying to make my students focus.
> I can see why they can't focus.
# h1-room-hands-back
Huh?
Anyway, I don't want to lose my job, but it's not just about me!
It's about all the preceding professors and their ongoing legacy. I cannot disappoint them!
> Right, I just don't get it why you need me.
# h1-room-hands-back, h1-hermione-speaking
I've been researching potential solutions and happened upon a recipe for a remarkable potion.
# h1-room-hands-back
I believe it's my only hope of retaining my job.
> Yes, but why do you need me specifically?
# h1-room-hands-back, h1-hermione-speaking
Right, well, one of the ingredients is a unique spirit essence.
# h1-room-hands-back
The essence is... well, um...
# h1-room-hands-back, h1-hermione-closed-eyes-speaking
It's the equivalent of human semen!
# h1-room-hands-back, h1-hermione-surprised
Ah.. I can't believe I just said that.
> Oh! Well, uh, I think I can help with that.
# h1-room-hands-back, h1-hermione-super-surprised
Really?!
> Of course.
# h1-room-hands-back, h1-hermione-laughing
I'm so relieved! I was apprehensive that you would decline.
> This potion... Seems quite the measure to take for teenagers.
Yes, it is, but desperate times and all...
# h1-room-hands-back, h1-hermione-speaking
I read about it in an ancient parchment from the library archives.
The potion was used by mages of old to gain luck, charisma, even a commanding aura.
I thought it may help me capture their attention, make them respect me, listen to me.
Basically the potion is similar to the famous Elixir of Fortune, but much stronger.
# h1-room-hands-back
> And to brew this potion you also needed to summon a spirit?
# h1-room-hands-back, h1-hermione-speaking
Yes, exactly. The potion requires the essence of a powerful spirit. You fit the description perfectly, and I'm thankful you're here.
> You went through a great deal to prepare this all, didn't you?
It was challenging. In fact, the art of summoning is taboo.
But some old tomes of the forbidden section hold the knowledge.
It took several nights of stealthy studies, acquiring scarce and expensive ingredients, endless preparation to get to here.
And most importantly, I've gathered all the required information on how to extract... the essence.
> It seems like you've really done your research.
I had to. It is a matter of necessity.
# h1-room-hands-back
Shall we start the extraction?
>> Oh, absolutely! (h1-table)
> Could you provide more details on the extraction process? You know, just in case.
# h1-room-hands-back, h1-hermione-speaking
Well, of course. I'll be positioning myself right here...
... here, on the border of this seemingly sturdy table and...
# h1-room-hands-back
I'll delicately utilize my hands, if that suits you.
> Just your hands?
# h1-room-hands-back, h1-hermione-surprised
What are you implying? I need the essence, not anything more unnecessary.
I'm not the type of woman to exploit every... opportunity.
> Opportunity?
You understand my point! Additionally, you're unreasonably large, so... Even if I wanted to...
# h1-room-hands-back, h1-hermione-closed-eyes-speaking
It would be physically impossible.
# h1-room-hands-back, h1-hermione-surprised
And do bear in mind, this is not an insinuation of my own desires of course.
# h1-room-hands-back
I... I don't harbor any personal interest in... that.
> In "that", huh?
# h1-room-hands-back, h1-hermione-surprised
S-stop putting words in my mouth! I merely need the essence for the potion.
# h1-room-hands-back, h1-hermione-speaking
You should consider yourself lucky that I even chose you for this.
# h1-room-hands-back
> Alright, alright.
Thank you for understanding. I must admit, I'm a bit nervous.
# h1-room-hands-back, h1-hermione-speaking
I've never done something like this before. I mean, with a spirit.
# h1-room-hands-back
> Don't stress too much, I'm easygoing.
# h1-room-hands-back, h1-hermione-speaking
I must say, your trust gives me more confidence. I promise it will be worth it.
# h1-room-hands-back
So, are you ready to start?
>> Oh, absolutely! (h1-table)
