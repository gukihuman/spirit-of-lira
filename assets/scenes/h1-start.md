> What the... What is this hand?
Do you hear me?
> Not really.
Oh! Wait, what? How could you answer if you couldn't... Very funny!
Are you a spirit?
> No.
Hmm... I think you are, and you're just joking.
You must be a spirit! No one else can be summoned by this spell.
> A spell? What are you talking about, hand?
I'm summoning you, of course, spirit.
> All I see is a hand sticking out from a tree.
Interesting...
I've heard that realities could merge in some humorous ways, but a hand sticking out of a tree? That's something new.
Anyway, please hold my hand.
>> Sure, here. (h1-room)
> No, you suspicious tree! Never!
Oh... No, please, Mr. Spirit! I promise you won't be disappointed!
> Would you trust a hand that suddenly appears from a tree?
I don't know. I guess not.
Okay, let me check the recommendations in the book. Here on this page... Ahem...
I'm gonna be a good girl for my daddy.
How was that?
> Um... Given that it's coming from a strange hand, it was weird.
Please, Mr. Spirit! Just put your hand on mine!
>> Sure, here. (h1-room)
> I have an idea.

I can feel something... wait...
Uh... yes, definitely some energy is flowing. But something is off...
The summoning isn't working. Did you put your hand on mine?
> Not exactly.
Please, please, please! I... Okay, give me a second...
Let me see this page...
Okay, found it! Wow, this is quite bold... Ehem...
I'm a... a slut.
I live for craving your balls.
...
Spirit?
> Damn, convincing. Alright, I'm in.

Oh, really? Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!
So, as a part of the ritual, I am asking you, spirit. Will you hold my hand with yours?
>> Sure, here. (h1-room)
