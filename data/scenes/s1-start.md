Oh Nighty Goddess! I am Lira. I came to your shrine, the magic tree.
I am all nude, as I heard, you prefer. I want to ask for help!
...
Anyone hear me?
# nighty-empty

# nighty
Well well well, what a cute girl!
What do you need, sweetie?
# lira-arms-down, lira-BLUE-LIGHT
Me and my friend Bunny suffer from bunbos.
They ruin our vegetable garden and start to be even aggressive lately.
That's not all, there is so many danger in the forest.
Would you be so kind and give us some protection?
# nighty
Hmm... I may help you, but it would be a little... naughty.
Are you sure you can handle that?
# lira-arms-down, lira-BLUE-LIGHT
Naughty? What do you mean?
# nighty
I can connect you with a spirit, who will always be with you.
He will guide your mind and body through all the difficulties.
...
If you make him happy.
# lira-arms-down, lira-BLUE-LIGHT
Wow! That would be so great!
But I still don't understand, what do I need to do for him?
# nighty
Well, as I said, it's most likely be a little naughty.
So, what do you decide?
# lira-arms-down, lira-BLUE-LIGHT
I...
I agree.
So, when is the spirit will came?
# nighty
Oh, he's already here.
# nighty-close
Aren't you, spirit?
> Oh yeah, I am. You look good.
Thanks, sweetie. Welcome to this world!
Would you agree to help this girl?
> Helping girls is my destiny!
Alright, to make a connection I need you to ask Lira for something that would make you happy.
> Ok, let's see.
# lira-arms-down, lira-BLUSH, lira-EYES-AT-VIEWER, lira-BLUE-LIGHT
Um.. Hello, spirit...
Welcome to this world... I guess.
> Hi. Do you always so shy?
No, it's just...
I am nude, as you can see. And...
...and I didn't expect a male spirit to be here.
> Don't worry. So, this translucent women says you need to make me happy. I have an idea.
Oh... Yes?
> Raise your arms, girl.
What!? I...
I am naked!
> That's very fortunate. Now, do you need my help or not?
I guess I do...
# lira-arms-raised, lira-BLUE-LIGHT

...
> Very nice. I'm impressed.
Um... Are you happy?
>> Yeah. Good girl. (s1-end)
> Not quite. Can you sit back as you were?
# lira-arms-down, lira-BLUSH, lira-EYES-AT-VIEWER, lira-BLUE-LIGHT
Well, here. Happy?
>> Yeah. Good girl. (s1-end)
> Now raise your arms again.
Again!?
> You already did it, second time should be easy.
# lira-arms-raised, lira-BLUE-LIGHT
I didn't think it would be so...
...embarrassing.
> Don't be. Your body is beautiful.
Do you think so?
> Absolutely.
...
Thanks. Well, can we be done now?
>> Yeah. Good girl. (s1-end)
> Put your arms down.
Oh god...
# lira-arms-down, lira-BLUSH, lira-EYES-AT-VIEWER, lira-BLUE-LIGHT
...
Let me guess, do you want me to raise my arms again?
> I actually wanted to end this.
Oh... Really?
> No, raise them.

I hope your help will worth it.

A little!?
